# SkillSync-AI-Enhanced-Job-Matching-and-Conversational-Search

Final Project for CMU 95820 Application of NL(X) and LLM

**Note: For this project, it is recommended to run the code on Google Colab with T4 GPU for better compatibility.**

# Install necessary packages

Install the necessary packages by running the following command:

```
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Code Usage

First of all, please clone this repository and `cd` into the repository so since the paths inside the code are hard-coded. Use the following command in Google Colab:

```
!git clone https://github.com/georgepan900530/SkillSync-AI-Enhanced-Job-Matching-and-Conversational-Search.git
%cd SkillSync-AI-Enhanced-Job-Matching-and-Conversational-Search
```

For the rest of the code, one can simply run through all the code block on Googl Colab and produce the results. It is worth noting that one should replace the OpenAI key in LLM section with his/her own key in order to run the LLM.
